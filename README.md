##Overview

Kepler2 is an evolution of Kepler. An open source Research and Data Collection portal. Kepler2 is currently it's working name. The platform will be API centric allowing for developers to build their own consumers. However, it will include visual tools as well.

##Goals

The goal of Kepler2 is to create a sustainable community of API powered research projects to benefit civic hackers, health researchers, academia, and governments.
This platform will be open and honest from day one and encourage contributions from any use case. The platform itself aims to use hypermedia to create robust client
and server interactions with minimal need for constant redeployments. This project will also look to run on minimal amounts of hardware to make adoption and maintenance trivial
for any new projects. It will also look to expose an API for your data after you have collected it.
